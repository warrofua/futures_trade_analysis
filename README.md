# Futures Trade Analysis

This repository contains a Python-based analytics workflow for exploring Sierra Chart futures trade logs (configured for Micro E-mini S&P 500 futures - MES - by default). The tool builds profit-and-loss summaries, a profitability heatmap, and distribution visualizations to help evaluate trading performance across time.

## Key Features
- **Cumulative P&L tracking** – visualize how profits evolve over the trading period.
- **Day/hour profitability heatmap** – surface the sessions that historically worked best (or worst) for you.
- **PnL distribution histogram** – highlight the skew of winning versus losing trades.
- **PnL range summary table** – break trades into performance buckets for rapid review.
- **Institutional-grade performance metrics** – calculate expectancy, Sharpe ratio, win/loss efficiencies, drawdowns, and time-in-market insights.
- **Sample dataset & report** – included so you can explore the workflow without exporting your own log first.

## Quick Start
1. **Install dependencies** (preferably inside a virtual environment):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the analysis script**:
   ```bash
   python trade_analysis_script.py
   ```
3. **Select a Sierra Chart trade log** when prompted (tab-separated `.txt`). The script will transform the timestamps to US/Eastern, calculate trade PnL, and display:
   - a cumulative P&L line chart,
   - a profitability heatmap by day of week and hour,
   - a PnL distribution histogram, and
   - tabular summaries in the terminal.

> **Tip:** If you are testing the project, choose the bundled sample file at `sample_data/trade_log_sample.txt` when the file dialog opens.

## Input Data Expectations
The script expects a tab-separated text file with at least the following Sierra Chart columns:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `TransDateTime` | UTC timestamp of the execution (will be localized to US/Eastern). |
| `Symbol` | Instrument symbol (e.g., `MESU3`). |
| `Quantity` | Number of contracts. |
| `BuySell` | Direction of the fill (`buy`/`sell`). |
| `FillPrice` | Execution price scaled by 100 (Sierra Chart default for MES). |
| `OpenClose` | Whether the fill opens or closes a position. |
| `HighDuringPosition` | Highest price reached while the position was open (scaled by 100). |
| `LowDuringPosition` | Lowest price reached while the position was open (scaled by 100). |

Trades in other instruments can be analyzed by adjusting the `tick_value` and `ticks_per_point` constants in `calculate_trade_pnl` inside `trade_analysis_script.py`.

## Sample Data & Report
A comprehensive two-week sample dataset is provided under [`sample_data/trade_log_sample.txt`](sample_data/trade_log_sample.txt). The companion [sample report](docs/sample_report.md) demonstrates what the analysis outputs look like when run against that file, including:

- the cumulative P&L progression,
- day/hour profitability insights,
- PnL distribution buckets, and
- key takeaways observed from the trades, expectancy, Sharpe ratio, and other performance metrics.

Use the sample dataset to familiarize yourself with the workflow or to validate new features with predictable results. If you would like a richer preview without running the script, explore the overview below and the annotated walkthrough in [`docs/sample_report.md`](docs/sample_report.md).

### Sample Report Overview
The HTML report generated by `trade_analysis_script.py` arranges the results into five digestible sections so you can understand performance at a glance:

1. **Headline results** – Summary statistics cards surface the 45 closed trades in the sample, the 22 trading days covered, and the $1,190 net gain, alongside averages such as $54.09 per day and the worst drawdown of $-60.00.
2. **Performance metrics** – Expectancy, Sharpe ratio, win/loss breakdowns, and exposure metrics contextualize consistency and risk; Monte Carlo outputs keep risk-of-ruin and percentile equity bands in view.
3. **Visual highlights** – Charts focus on the cumulative equity curve, the distribution of trade outcomes, and the day/hour heatmap that reveals where performance clusters during the New York morning session.
4. **Profitability tables** – Scrollable tables detail profitability by session, daily contributions, and how trades group into P&L buckets for expectancy checks.
5. **Risk diagnostics** – Drawdown summaries, volatility regimes, and percentile bands frame the depth, duration, and variability of pullbacks so you can calibrate position sizing.

#### Re-create the Visuals Locally
Binary screenshots are intentionally omitted from version control, but you can regenerate every figure shown in the report with the sample dataset:

1. Run `python trade_analysis_script.py`.
2. When prompted for a file, select `sample_data/trade_log_sample.txt`.
3. Choose an output directory when the script asks where to save the HTML report.

The generated HTML export contains the cumulative equity curve, day/hour heatmap, distribution histograms, and risk diagnostics discussed above. Open it in your browser to explore the interactive charts or capture your own screenshots.

## Customization Ideas
- Swap in your own tick values or add symbol-specific configurations.
- Extend the plotting routines to save images to disk for use in journals.
- Automate report creation (e.g., export aggregated tables to Excel or Markdown).
