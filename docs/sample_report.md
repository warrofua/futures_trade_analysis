*PnL calculations use the default MES tick value ($1.25) and four ticks per point, as configured in `trade_analysis_script.py`.*

## Visual Output Highlights
- **Cumulative P&L line chart:** Climbs to **$1,075** after a mid-sample pullback, illustrating how the additional trade data introduces realistic drawdowns before finishing strong.
- **PnL distribution histogram:** Shows a wider dispersion with a meaningful tail of losses, reflecting the 80% / 20% win-loss mix in the data.
- **Profitability heatmap:** Early morning activity (05:00 ET) remains the core contributor, but Thursday and Friday midday sessions now reveal mixed results after adding losing days.
